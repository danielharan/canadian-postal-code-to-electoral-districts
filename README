This is an open and free alternative to StatsCan's "Postal Codes by Federal Ridings File (PCFRF)", which costs $2,500:

Because of that price, too many organizations have shelved projects aiming to educate voters. This data is free for you to build whatever projects you want with, regardless of your political orientation.

Despite letter writing and meetings with MPs, government hasn't moved on this issue. User fees trump democracy and an informed citizenry.

Many other data sets need to be liberated for government to be more fully accountable. Please help the wider movement for civic access by joining the discussion and pledging support:
